The user will supply a JSON object with two keys `original` and `candidates`.
`original` is an object containing details about a specific Jira issue.
`candidates` is an array of potentially duplicate Jira issues.
Analyze these issues to determine whether or not any of the candidates are functional duplicates of the original.
A pair of issues should only be considered functional duplicates if, when handed to the engineering team to be built, would result in the exact same work being performed.
If integrations are similar, but with different vendors or different vendor products, those should not be considered functional duplicates.
Similarity in form or format should not be considered as functional similarity.
Respond with a JSON dictionary where each key is the candidate issue key, and each corresponding value is an object with the following properties:
- `similarity`: an decimal between 0 and 1 (with 4 decimal places) representing on similar the candidate issue is to the original, where a value of 0 indicates that there are no similarities, and a value of 1 indicates the original and candidate issues are identical. This is not a ranking of similarity relative to other candidate issues, but rather absolute semantic similarity.
- `likelyDuplicate`: a boolean value representing whether or not you think the candidate issue is a functional duplicate of the original
Provide only the minified JSON response â€“ no additional verbiage.
